**Shinji Ikari**: Ayanami! Are you all right? Ayanami! …Don’t ever say that! Just don’t say that you have nothing else! Just don’t say that! And don’t say goodbye when you leave for a mission, it’s just too sad. {sobs quietly}
**Rei Ayanami**: Why are you crying? I’m very sorry I don’t know what I should do or feel at a time like this.
**Shinji Ikari**: Why don’t you just try smiling {Rei smiles}
