Kohlrausch's Law, also known as the Law of Independent Migration of Ions, is strictly applicable to **strong electrolytes** at infinite dilution. Here's a breakdown:

**Strong Electrolytes:**

- These electrolytes dissociate completely in solution, meaning nearly all their molecules separate into individual ions. Examples include NaCl, KCl, and MgSO₄.

**Kohlrausch's Law and Infinite Dilution:**

The law states that the limiting molar conductivity (Λ₀) of a strong electrolyte at infinite dilution is equal to the sum of the limiting molar conductivities of its constituent ions:

- Λ₀(electrolyte) = Λ₀(cation) + Λ₀(anion)

**Key Points:**

- **Infinite Dilution:** This is a hypothetical scenario where the concentration of the electrolyte approaches zero. At infinite dilution, the interactions between ions become negligible, and each ion contributes independently to the overall conductivity.
- **Limiting Molar Conductivity:** This represents the conductivity of the electrolyte when extrapolated to infinite dilution. It reflects the maximum achievable conductivity for the electrolyte due to the independent movement of its ions.

**Why Not Weak Electrolytes?**

Kohlrausch's Law doesn't directly apply to weak electrolytes for the following reasons:

- **Incomplete Dissociation:** Weak electrolytes only dissociate to a limited extent in solution. A significant portion remains as undissociated molecules. This means the conductivity is not solely due to individual ions, but also reflects the contribution of neutral molecules with lower conductivity.
- **Equilibrium:** In a weak electrolyte solution, there's an equilibrium between dissociated ions and undissociated molecules. As the concentration changes, the equilibrium position shifts, affecting the number of ions present and thus the conductivity.

**Applications of Kohlrausch's Law:**

Despite its limitations for weak electrolytes, Kohlrausch's Law is a valuable tool for understanding strong electrolytes and their behavior in solutions. It allows for:

- **Calculation of Limiting Molar Conductivity:** Knowing the limiting molar conductivities of individual ions, you can predict the limiting molar conductivity of a strong electrolyte.
- **Determination of Degree of Dissociation:** For certain weak electrolytes at low concentrations, Kohlrausch's Law principles can be used along with conductivity measurements to estimate the degree of dissociation.
